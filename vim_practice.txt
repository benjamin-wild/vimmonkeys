=====================VIM PRACTICE===========================

Welcome to my Vim Practice tool where users can get more 
comfortable using the keybindings of vim to become true 
vimonkeys. The goal is to complete these exercises as quickly
and correctly as possible. To ensure you have less setup 
work each time, remember to copy and paste the editing line
before moving on(it's more practice that way too). Without 
further ado, enter the excersises and complete them to the 
best of your ability. Proceed to (--->) to start the problem
